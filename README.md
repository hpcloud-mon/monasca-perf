# Tools and investigation results, regarding performance in Monasca:


monasca-perf
============

Performance testing tools:

perf.py - sends x requests as fast as it can to the api and exits.

  time python perf.py

agent_simulator.py - sends requests once (default) or continously to the api.
  Simulates agent sends by having a configurable send interval per process(server).

  python agent_simulatory.py

perfprocess.py - sends x requests as fast as it can and exits.

  time python perfprocess.py  num_processes  num_threads  num_requests_per_thread  num_metrics_per_request

check.py - after restarting the persisters, run this on the persister server for stats.

  python check.py

influx_load.py - does a bunch of metric writes to an influx cluster

  time python influx_load.py  num_processes  num_threads  num_requests_per_thread  num_metrics_per_request  series_name  db_username  db_password

influx_host_list.py - Lists the hosts with data stored on influxdb + handles agent amplification

  python influx_host_list.py  dbusername  dbpassword  url

Performance evaluation tools:

analyze_persister.py - Queries the Monasca Java Persister metrics endpoint to print a summary of persister activity

  python analyze_persister.py
